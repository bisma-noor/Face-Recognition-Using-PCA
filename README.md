# Face-Recognition-Using-PCA
This project implements a face recognition system using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Eigenfaces method). It preprocesses facial images, computes eigenfaces, and projects images onto a lower-dimensional space. Recognition is performed using Euclidean distance, and accuracy is calculated.  Tech: Python, NumPy, PIL
